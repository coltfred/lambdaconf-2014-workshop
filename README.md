# Complexity and Reasoning

Before the workshop begins, please take the time to do the following:

```

./bin/sbt test

```

This will download all of the required dependencies you'll need, including
the SBT launcher, the Scala compiler, and so forth, and will ensure that
your system is set up to be able to do the exercises.
